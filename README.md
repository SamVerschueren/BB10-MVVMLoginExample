## What is it?
MVVM stands for Model View ViewModel and is an architectural pattern. It is largely
based on the Model View Controller pattern. MVVM is targeted at modern UI development 
platforms which support event-driven programming.

MVVM for QML is a work in proress. If you have something to share or if you have more
ideas on the topic, do not hesitate to contact us.

## Example
The example tries to make use of the MVVM design principles. For now, it's just a simple
login page with a simple ViewModel. No models are used so far. The goal is to extend
this example and add more features to it.
